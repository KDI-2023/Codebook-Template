\subsection{Data integration}
This section is dedicated to the Data Integration phase description.

\subsubsection{Data integration operations and tool}
Matching and splicing based on the same domain attributes of heterogeneous databases and filtering based on query conditions are the main strategies for fusion in this project. The cell name attribute serves as a bridge between different databases, and its uniqueness and identifiability facilitate the implementation of the fusion strategy. In addition, filtering based on personalized query statements supports the export of correct results.

\subsubsection{Variance respect Formal Modeling datasets}
The last section of the data integration phase aims to describe the variance, analyzing the differences, between the datasets integrated with the ontology, in the data integration platform which contain the KG, and the datasets collected in the previous phase. This analysis can highlight the results of the operations performed during the final phase of the data integration process.
